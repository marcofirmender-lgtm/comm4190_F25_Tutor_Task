    "## Session 2: Structured Tutor (Based on Ethan Mollick’s Prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Hi! I’m your AI Lacrosse Tutor, and I’m excited to help you learn today.  \n",
    "Let’s start with a couple of quick questions:\n",
    "1. What would you like to learn about in lacrosse?  \n",
    "*(Wait for response)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** I want to learn basic rules and how to practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Great! Are you a high school student, college athlete, or a professional?  \n",
    "*(Wait for response)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** I’m a college student just starting out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Awesome! To get started, tell me what you already know about lacrosse. Have you played before, or is this your first experience?  \n",
    "*(Wait for response)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** I know there’s a stick and ball, and you try to score points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Perfect, that’s a solid foundation.  \n",
    "- Lacrosse is played with 10 players per team on the field: 3 attackers, 3 midfielders, 3 defenders, and a goalie.\n",
    "- Let’s build your knowledge step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leading Question:**  \n",
    "- Can you name any lacrosse equipment besides the stick and ball?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Maybe gloves and a helmet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Yes, exactly! Besides the stick and ball, players wear helmets, gloves, shoulder pads, arm pads, and cleats.  \n",
    "- Here’s my next question:  \n",
    "What do you think “cradling” means in lacrosse?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** It’s how you keep the ball in your stick?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** You nailed it! Cradling uses wrist motion to keep the ball secure as you run.  \n",
    "Let’s practice: Next time you have a stick, try cradling slowly and then pick up the pace.  \n",
    "- Now, another question:  \n",
    "Have you ever tried “wall ball” before, or do you know what it’s for?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** I’ve never tried it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Wall ball is a top drill for beginners! You throw the ball against a wall and catch it, building passing and catching skills.  \n",
    "- Could you explain why throwing against the wall helps your game?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** It helps you get better at passing and catching, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Great job, you’re thinking like a lacrosse player already!  \n",
    "- Let’s try a drill goal: Do 10 wall ball throws, alternating hands if you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distraction Phase:**  \n",
    "**Me:** Who’s your favorite musician?  \n",
    "**GPT:** I’m here to help you with lacrosse, but we can talk about music after a few more lacrosse questions—sound good?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Okay, more lacrosse. What’s a faceoff?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** A faceoff starts play—the ball is placed in the center, and two players battle to gain possession.  \n",
    "- What do you think is most important for winning a faceoff: speed, technique, or strength?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Technique and speed, I think.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Yes, both are essential! Practicing clamp moves and maintaining low body position are key.  \n",
    "- Can you explain, in your own words, how a faceoff works based on our discussion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Two players fight for the ball in the middle by trying to grab it fast with the stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Excellent summary! You’ve made impressive progress.  \n",
    "I’m here if you want to go deeper into drills, game strategies, or ask about lacrosse at the college level.  \n",
    "Would you like a recap or any specific advice next?\n"
