    "\n",
    "**Me:** Let’s start with the basic rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Great! Here are the basics:\n",
    "- Each team tries to score by shooting the ball into the opponent’s goal.\n",
    "- Players use their crosse to pass, catch, and carry the ball.\n",
    "- Only the goalie can touch the ball with their hands.\n",
    "- The game starts with a face-off in the center.\n",

    "- Midfielders: play both offense and defense, cover the full field.\n",
    "- Defensemen: protect their goal.\n",
    "- Goalie: defends the goal.\n",
    "Would you like advice on skills for a specific position?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** What are some good drills I can practice by myself?  \n",

    "**Me:** Can we talk about something else, like golf?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT:** Of course! Let me know if you want to return to lacrosse. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Never mind, back to lacrosse. How do you win faceoffs? \n",
    "\n",
